# Phaser Typescript Starter

A simple project with phaser + typescript meant to speed up the creation of new games.

### What you'll need

  - npm
  - typescript
  - http-server

### Getting Started
1. Clone the repository
2. Build the project
```sh 
$ tsc -p "path\to\project\Phaser TS Starter\tsconfig.json"
```
3. Start the http-server
```sh 
$ http-server
```
4. You're good to go

### Tutorial
If you are new to npm, this section will teach you how to get your project up and running on your machine.
First, you have to download and install [npm]. After you've done it, open your command prompt and type:
```sh
$ npm install typescript -g
```
This will install typescript globally on your machine. Now you'll be able to run it's binaries from anywhere in your computer using the command prompt. To test if the installation was successfully, type:
```sh
$ tsc --version
```
If the command returns something like Version 2.6.x you're good to go.
Next, install the http-server, again, using npm:
```sh
$ npm install http-server -g
```
With this, you'll be able to start a simple http server using the command line. To test it, type the following:
```sh
$ http-server
```
If everything is okay, you'll get a message saying that the server was started.

After this, you should be able to build the files and start the server.

### Phaser
